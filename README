gp.py is a thin subprocess wrapper around a gnuplot instance.  There are convenience methods for gnuplot 'set', 'plot', and 'splot' commands.  Otherwise the gnuplot interaction is as plain as conveniently possible.  Interaction occurs via the GP.stdin and GP.stdout functions.  Currently, data is passed to gnuplot by temporary files.  Other than this, there is no 'magic': no obfuscation of gnuplot syntax or commands.
